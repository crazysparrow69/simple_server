This is a simple node.js server. It works by getting GET requests and responding with a page that the user requested in URL, writing every request's log. The project was made for practical experience.
I learnt basics of how to create a node server by working with default packages such as 'http', 'path', 'fs', 'events', and also some packages installed with npm - 'date-fns', 'uuid' and 'nodemon'.
